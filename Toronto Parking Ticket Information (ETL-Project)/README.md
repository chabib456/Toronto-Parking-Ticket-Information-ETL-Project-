# ETL-Project
We used two different data sets. One as a Json format and another as a CSV.  
We are combining data from Green P parking for the year 2015 with parking tickets issued by the City of Toronto for the same year.
We cleaned the data by year and street parking address.
Data is intended to be used for easy analysis and identification of any trends (i.e. frequently issued tickets, parking tickets per parking, average fines, etc.)
